# Hunger-Buddy

I developed an engaging Zomato clone using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This project seamlessly integrates interactive features through React for dynamic user interfaces, while Node.js handles efficient server-side operations
I've removed the node modules. To set up the project, please run "npm i" in the command prompt to install the dependencies.
